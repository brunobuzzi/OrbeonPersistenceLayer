# This command will start a multi-thread Web Application Server where each port will be attended by a different (Gem) process. 
# Following the previous example three Gem processes will be created to attend each port. 
# The ports to be attended are defined in ports-all.ini. 
# At registration time (register-application.sh) there is a list of ports in ports-all.ini and each will be active when this script is executed.

After executing this script some pid and log files will be create at $GS_HOME/server/stones/devKit_34/logs/. In this case is the path includes devKit_34 because the Stone was created with that name. The  pid and log files will be like BPM_server-8787.log and BPM_server-8787.pid. A pair of these file will be create per each port defined in ports-all.ini.
